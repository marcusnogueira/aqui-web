# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature refactors the vendor dashboard UI to improve usability, visual clarity, and logical content organization. The refactor focuses on frontend layout and structure with the addition of gallery image upload functionality for vendor offerings. The goal is to create a more intuitive and visually appealing dashboard experience while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

4. WHEN the sidebar is rendered THEN it SHALL be responsive and collapse appropriately on mobile devices

### Requirement 2

6. WHEN images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL resize/compress images to optimize storage and bandwidth
7. WHEN a vendor uploads duplicate images THEN the system SHALL deduplicate or prompt a warning
8. WHEN gallery images exist THEN the system SHALL display them in a responsive grid layout
9. WHEN a vendor wants to remove an image THEN the system SHALL provide delete functionality
10. WHEN editing the gallery THEN the system SHALL allow reordering images via drag-and-drop

### Requirement 3

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display content in a logical, visually clear layout
2. WHEN sections are displayed THEN they SHALL have consistent spacing, typography, and visual treatment
3. WHEN forms are rendered THEN they SHALL follow a consistent design pattern with proper validation feedback
4. WHEN data is displayed THEN it SHALL use appropriate visual elements (cards, tables, lists) for the content type

### Requirement 4

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a vendor, I want all existing dashboard functionality to remain intact after the UI refactor, so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN vendor data is displayed THEN it SHALL show the same information as before the refactor
3. WHEN forms are submitted THEN they SHALL use the same API endpoints and validation logic

### Requirement 6

2. WHEN gallery images are shown THEN they SHALL be displayed in an attractive, responsive layout
3. WHEN no gallery images exist THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the empty state
