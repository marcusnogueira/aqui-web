# Implementation Plan Status (2025-07-22)

This document outlines the status of each task in the implementation plan, based on a review of the codebase.

---

## ✅ Working & Verified

### 1. Database Schema Updates and Constraints
-   **Status**: **DONE**.
-   **Evidence**: The migration file `supabase/migrations/20250721220000_add_require_vendor_approval_only.sql` adds the `require_vendor_approval` and `allow_auto_vendor_approval` fields to `platform_settings`, and the `status` and `rejection_reason` fields to `vendors`.
-   **Note**: The task mentions adding unique constraints to `vendors`, which I cannot verify without seeing the table creation script. However, the API logic in `become-vendor` checks for existing vendors, which provides a level of protection.

### 2. Enhanced vendor creation API with proper error handling
-   **2.1 Update become-vendor API endpoint**: **DONE**. The API route `app/api/user/become-vendor/route.ts` checks if a vendor already exists for the user.
-   **2.3 Update vendor creation to use require_vendor_approval setting**: **DONE**. The API route `app/api/user/become-vendor/route.ts` fetches the `allow_auto_vendor_approval` setting and sets the initial status of the vendor accordingly.

### 4. Navigation component UI logic updates
-   **4.1 Update Navigation component vendor status display logic**: **DONE**. `components/Navigation.tsx` correctly displays different options based on `user.is_vendor` and `user.active_role`.
-   **4.2 Implement session refresh in Navigation component**: **DONE**. The `checkAuth` function is called after role switching to refresh the user's profile data.

### 6. Vendor dashboard page route protection
-   **6.1 Add route guard to vendor dashboard page**: **DONE**. `app/vendor/dashboard/page.tsx` checks for a vendor profile and redirects to `/vendor/onboarding` if it's not found.

---

## ❌ Not Working or Needs Fixing

### 2. Enhanced vendor creation API with proper error handling
-   **2.2 Implement session refresh functionality after vendor creation**: **NOT WORKING**. The `become-vendor` API route updates the user's role in the database, but there is no mechanism to trigger a session refresh on the client side. The user will have to manually refresh the page to see the updated role in the UI.
    -   **Recommendation**: The API should return a specific response that indicates a session refresh is needed, or the client-side function that calls the API should be responsible for triggering the refresh.

### 3. Middleware enhancements for vendor route protection
-   **3.1 Add vendor route guards to middleware**: **NOT WORKING**. The `middleware.ts` file only protects admin routes. It does not have any logic to protect vendor routes like `/vendor/dashboard` or `/vendor/onboarding`.
-   **3.2 Test middleware route protection behavior**: **NOT WORKING**. Since the middleware logic is missing, the tests for it are also likely missing or would fail.

### 5. Vendor onboarding page improvements
-   **5.1 Add route guard to vendor onboarding page**: **NOT WORKING**. There is no logic in `app/vendor/onboarding/page.tsx` to redirect a user who is already a vendor to the dashboard.
-   **5.2 Enhance error handling and display in onboarding form**: **PARTIALLY WORKING**. The form displays errors, but not as toasts. There is no client-side validation for email/phone formats.
-   **5.3 Implement proper redirect after successful vendor creation**: **NOT WORKING**. The form redirects to `/vendor/onboarding/confirmation` instead of `/vendor/dashboard`.

### 7. Admin settings for vendor approval control
-   **7.1 Add require_vendor_approval toggle to admin settings**: **NOT SEEN**. I have not been asked to review the admin settings page, so I cannot verify this.
-   **7.2 Update admin vendor management interface**: **PARTIALLY WORKING**. The `app/admin/vendor-status/page.tsx` page shows the approval status and allows admins to approve/reject vendors. However, it displays the `require_vendor_approval` setting, which may be the wrong flag if `allow_auto_vendor_approval` is the one being used in the vendor creation API. This needs to be consolidated.

### 8. Comprehensive testing and validation
-   **Status**: **NOT VERIFIED**. I have not reviewed the test files in detail. Given the number of issues found in the application logic, it is likely that the tests are either missing or will fail.

### 9. Database type generation and cleanup
-   **9.1 Regenerate database types to include new fields**: **NOT WORKING**. The `become-vendor` API route uses `as any` when inserting vendor data, which indicates that the database types are not up to date.
