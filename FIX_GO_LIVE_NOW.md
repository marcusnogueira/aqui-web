# üö® GO-LIVE CRITICAL FIX - DO THIS NOW!

## **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:**
- Your app moved to `localhost:3002` (new instance)
- You're testing on `localhost:3001` (old cached version)  
- Old version still has direct database calls = RLS policy errors

## **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:**

### **Step 1: Use Correct URL**
- ‚ùå **STOP using:** `localhost:3001` 
- ‚úÖ **START using:** `localhost:3002`

### **Step 2: Clear Browser Cache**
1. **Hard refresh:** `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)
2. **Or open incognito/private window**
3. **Or clear browser cache completely**

### **Step 3: Test Go-Live Again**
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3002/vendor/dashboard`
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Click "Go Live"  
4. Should now show: `üîç Starting go-live debug:` 
5. Should ask for location permission
6. Should work properly!

## **WHY THIS HAPPENED:**
- App restarted on new port due to port conflict
- Browser cached old JavaScript with direct database calls
- New version uses API endpoint (which bypasses RLS issues)

## **VERIFICATION:**
After switching to `localhost:3002`, you should see:
- ‚úÖ No more RLS policy errors
- ‚úÖ Location permission prompt appears  
- ‚úÖ Go-live works properly
- ‚úÖ Debug logs show proper API calls

**TRY THIS NOW - it should fix the go-live immediately!** üöÄ
