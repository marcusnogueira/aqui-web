# Vendor Onboarding Redirect Fix - Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the vendor onboarding redirect fix that ensures users are properly redirected to `/vendor/dashboard` instead of `/vendor/onboarding/confirmation` after successful vendor creation.

## 🐛 Bug Fixed

The original issue was that after completing vendor onboarding, users were redirected to a confirmation page (`/vendor/onboarding/confirmation`) instead of the vendor dashboard (`/vendor/dashboard`). This created a poor user experience as users couldn't immediately access their vendor features.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

1. **Redirect Fix**: Changed the redirect target from `/vendor/onboarding/confirmation` to `/vendor/dashboard`
2. **Session Update**: Enhanced session management to immediately update user data with vendor information
3. **Error Handling**: Maintained proper error handling for failed vendor creation attempts

## 🧪 Test Types

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/vendor-onboarding-redirect.test.ts`)

Tests the component logic in isolation:
- ✅ Successful redirect to `/vendor/dashboard`
- ✅ Session update with vendor data
- ✅ Error handling for API failures
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Regression prevention (no redirect to confirmation page)
- ✅ Backward compatibility with API responses

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/vendor-onboarding-redirect-integration.test.ts`)

Tests the complete user flow in a real browser:
- ✅ End-to-end vendor onboarding process
- ✅ Authentication and session management
- ✅ Form submission and validation
- ✅ Redirect behavior verification
- ✅ Dashboard functionality after redirect
- ✅ Error scenarios and edge cases

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Quick Start

Run all tests with the provided script:

```bash
./scripts/test-vendor-onboarding.sh
```

### Individual Test Commands

#### Unit Tests Only
```bash
# Using the script
./scripts/test-vendor-onboarding.sh --unit-only

# Or directly with npm
npm test tests/unit/vendor-onboarding-redirect.test.ts
```

#### Integration Tests Only
```bash
# Using the script
./scripts/test-vendor-onboarding.sh --integration-only

# Or directly with Playwright
npx playwright test tests/integration/vendor-onboarding-redirect-integration.test.ts
```

#### Headed Mode (Visible Browser)
```bash
./scripts/test-vendor-onboarding.sh --integration-only --headed
```

#### Verbose Output
```bash
./scripts/test-vendor-onboarding.sh --verbose
```

## 🛠 Test Configuration

The `tests/setup/test-config.ts` file contains:

- **Timeouts**: Configurable timeouts for different operations
- **Test Data**: Generators for test emails, business names, etc.
- **Utilities**: Helper functions for common test operations
- **Mock Data**: Predefined test data for consistent testing

### Key Utilities

```typescript
// Create and sign in a test user
const email = await VendorTestUtils.createAndSignInTestUser(page)

// Fill vendor onboarding form
const formData = await VendorTestUtils.fillVendorOnboardingForm(page, {
  businessName: 'My Test Business',
  businessType: 'Food & Beverage'
})

// Submit form and verify redirect
await VendorTestUtils.submitVendorOnboardingForm(page)
await VendorTestUtils.verifyOnVendorDashboard(page)
```

## 📋 Test Scenarios Covered

### ✅ Happy Path
- User signs up → Goes to onboarding → Fills form → Submits → Redirected to dashboard
- Session is updated with vendor data
- Dashboard displays vendor information

### ⚠️ Error Scenarios
- API failures during vendor creation
- Network timeouts
- Invalid form data
- Duplicate business names

### 🔄 Edge Cases
- Pending approval status
- Different business types
- Address/location data
- Session persistence across redirect

### 🚫 Regression Prevention
- Ensures NO redirect to `/vendor/onboarding/confirmation`
- Verifies backward compatibility
- Tests form validation edge cases

## 🎯 Test Data

Tests use dynamically generated data to avoid conflicts:

```typescript
// Email: test-vendor-1703123456789-abc123@example.com
const email = TEST_CONFIG.generateTestEmail()

// Business: Test Business 1703123456789
const businessName = TEST_CONFIG.generateBusinessName()
```

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### Dependencies
```bash
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test jest @types/jest ts-jest
npx playwright install
```

### Environment Setup
1. Application must be running on `http://localhost:3000`
2. Database should be accessible for user creation
3. Authentication system should be functional

## 📊 Test Reports

After running tests, you'll see a summary:

```
📊 Test Summary
===============
✅ Unit tests: PASSED
✅ Integration tests: PASSED

The redirect fix is working correctly:
• Users are redirected to /vendor/dashboard after vendor creation
• Users are NOT redirected to /vendor/onboarding/confirmation
• Session data is properly updated with vendor information
• Error handling works as expected
```

## 🐛 Debugging Failed Tests

### Unit Test Failures
1. Check component imports and mocks
2. Verify API response structure matches expectations
3. Ensure test data is valid

### Integration Test Failures
1. Verify application is running on correct port
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Use `--headed` mode to see what's happening
4. Check network tab for failed API requests

### Common Issues

**Test timeouts**: Increase timeout values in `test-config.ts`

**Element not found**: Update selectors to match current DOM structure

**API errors**: Check server logs and database connectivity

**Authentication issues**: Verify auth system is working correctly

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

To run these tests in CI/CD:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step
- name: Run Vendor Onboarding Tests
  run: |
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start &
    sleep 10
    ./scripts/test-vendor-onboarding.sh
```

## 📝 Adding New Tests

When adding new test scenarios:

1. **Unit Tests**: Add to `vendor-onboarding-redirect.test.ts`
2. **Integration Tests**: Add to `vendor-onboarding-redirect-integration.test.ts`
3. **Utilities**: Add helper functions to `test-config.ts`
4. **Update Documentation**: Update this README with new scenarios

## 🎉 Success Criteria

All tests passing means:
- ✅ Redirect fix is working correctly
- ✅ No regression to confirmation page
- ✅ Session management is robust
- ✅ Error handling is comprehensive
- ✅ User experience is seamless

**Ready for production deployment! 🚀**
