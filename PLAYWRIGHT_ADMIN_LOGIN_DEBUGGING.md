# Playwright Admin Login Testing - Debugging Guide

## Issue Summary
The Playwright E2E tests for admin functionality are failing because the `/admin/login` route is returning a 404 error, even though the file `app/admin/login/page.tsx` exists.

## Investigation Results

### 1. File Structure Verification ✅
- `app/admin/login/page.tsx` exists and contains valid React component
- Admin login form has correct field IDs: `username` and `password`
- Submit button has correct text: "Sign in"

### 2. Server Status ❌
- Development server is running on `http://localhost:3000`
- `/admin/login` returns 404 status code
- Other admin routes also likely affected

### 3. Admin Credentials ✅
- Username: `mrn`
- Password: `mrn`
- User exists in `admin_users` table

## Current Test Configuration

```typescript
const ADMIN_USERNAME = 'mrn';
const ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'mrn';
const BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000';

// Login process
await page.goto(`${BASE_URL}/admin/login`);
await page.fill('input[id="username"]', ADMIN_USERNAME);
await page.fill('input[id="password"]', ADMIN_PASSWORD);
await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
```

## Potential Causes

1. **Next.js Route Resolution Issue**
   - App router not properly recognizing admin routes
   - Possible middleware interference
   - Build/compilation issues

2. **Middleware Configuration**
   - `middleware.ts` might be blocking admin routes
   - Authentication checks preventing access

3. **Development Server Issues**
   - Hot reload problems
   - Route caching issues
   - Port conflicts

## Recommended Solutions

### Solution 1: Server Restart
```bash
# Stop current server
# Restart development server
npm run dev
```

### Solution 2: Clear Next.js Cache
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Solution 3: Verify Route Structure
```bash
# Check if page.tsx files are properly formatted
# Ensure default exports are present
```

### Solution 4: Test Direct Access
```bash
# Test with curl
curl -I http://localhost:3000/admin/login

# Should return 200, not 404
```

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run specific admin login test
npx playwright test tests/e2e/admin-vendor-status.spec.ts -g "Admin Login" --headed

# Run manual test script
node tests/manual-admin-login-test.js

# View test report
npx playwright show-report
```

## Expected Behavior

1. Navigate to `/admin/login` → Should load login form
2. Fill credentials → Should accept input
3. Submit form → Should redirect to `/admin/dashboard`
4. Navigate to `/admin/vendor-status` → Should load vendor control panel

## Current Status
- ❌ Admin login page returns 404
- ❌ Tests failing due to route not found
- ✅ Credentials and form selectors are correct
- ✅ Test logic is properly structured

## Next Steps

1. Resolve 404 issue for admin routes
2. Verify middleware is not blocking access
3. Test authentication flow manually
4. Re-run Playwright tests
5. Document successful test execution
