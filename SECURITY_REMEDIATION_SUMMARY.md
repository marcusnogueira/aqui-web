# Security Remediation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the critical security vulnerabilities that were identified and remediated in the AQUI platform's database Row Level Security (RLS) policies and database setup scripts.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Overly Permissive GRANT Statements
**Problem**: The previous `setup-rls-policies.sql` file contained broad GRANT statements that gave INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE permissions to all authenticated users on vendor-specific tables, effectively bypassing the ownership checks in RLS policies.

**Example of Vulnerable Pattern**:
```sql
-- This policy correctly identifies the owner...
CREATE POLICY "Vendors can manage own specials" ON vendor_specials 
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() IN (SELECT user_id FROM vendors WHERE id = vendor_specials.vendor_id));
-- ...but this grant statement gives permissions to everyone.
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON vendor_specials TO authenticated;
```

### 2. Scattered and Conflicting Database Scripts
**Problem**: Multiple, conflicting SQL files for database setup created risk of misconfiguration:
- `admin-auth-schema.sql`
- `create-missing-tables.sql` 
- `create-vendor-live-sessions-table.sql`
- `create-vendor-reports-table.sql`
- `setup-rls-policies.sql`

### 3. Inconsistent Admin Authorization
**Problem**: Some RLS policies referenced the `admin_users` table directly, conflicting with the JWT-based admin system.

## Remediation Actions Taken

### Task 1: Database Script Consolidation
✅ **Created**: `V2_database_setup.sql` - A single, definitive database setup script
✅ **Deleted**: All redundant and deprecated setup scripts
✅ **Result**: Single source of truth for database schema

### Task 2: RLS Security Hardening
✅ **Removed**: Overly permissive GRANT statements
✅ **Implemented**: Proper ownership-based RLS policies for all vendor tables:
- `vendor_static_locations`
- `vendor_announcements` 
- `vendor_specials`
- `vendor_live_sessions`

✅ **Added**: DELETE policy for reviews table
✅ **Applied**: Secure policy pattern:
```sql
-- Public read access for all authenticated users
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view vendor specials" ON vendor_specials
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Only the vendor who owns the special can create, update, or delete it
CREATE POLICY "Vendors can manage their own specials" ON vendor_specials
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = (SELECT user_id FROM vendors WHERE id = vendor_specials.vendor_id))
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = (SELECT user_id FROM vendors WHERE id = vendor_specials.vendor_id));
```

### Task 3: Admin Authorization Standardization
✅ **Removed**: RLS policies that incorrectly referenced `admin_users` table
✅ **Standardized**: All admin operations use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` which bypasses RLS
✅ **Secured**: `admin_users` table only accessible via service role

## Security Improvements Achieved

### 1. Resource Ownership Enforcement
- Only vendors can modify their own locations, announcements, specials, and live sessions
- Only users can modify their own reviews, favorites, and reports
- Public read access maintained for discovery features

### 2. Admin Security
- Complete isolation of admin authentication from user authentication
- All admin operations use service role key (server-side only)
- No client-side access to admin data

### 3. Principle of Least Privilege
- Removed broad permissions that bypassed security controls
- Implemented granular, ownership-based access control
- Maintained necessary functionality while securing data

## Database Security Model

### Public vs Service Role Keys
- **Public Key (`anon`)**: Used client-side, security enforced by RLS policies
- **Service Role Key**: Used server-side only, bypasses RLS for admin operations

### RLS Policy Structure
- **SELECT policies**: Generally permissive for public data discovery
- **INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies**: Strict ownership validation
- **Admin tables**: Service role access only

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Run `V2_database_setup.sql` on production database
2. **Verify**: Test that vendor operations work correctly with new policies
3. **Monitor**: Ensure no legitimate operations are blocked
4. **Document**: Update API documentation to reflect security model
