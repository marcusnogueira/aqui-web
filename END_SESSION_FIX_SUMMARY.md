## 🔍 Debugging Features Added

### Browser Console Logs
Look for these log patterns:
- `🔄` - Operation starting
- `✅` - Successful operation
- `❌` - Error occurred
- `⚠️` - Warning or edge case

### API Response Debug Info
All API responses now include:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Live session ended successfully!",
  "debug": {
    "vendorId": "vendor-uuid",
    "sessionId": "session-uuid", 
    "endedAt": "2025-01-27T..."
  }
}
```

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "error": "Specific error message",
  "details": "Technical details",
  "debug": {
    "userId": "user-uuid",
    "vendorId": "vendor-uuid",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-27T..."
  }
}
```

## 🚀 How to Test the Fix

1. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Sign In as Vendor**
   - Use your vendor account
   - Ensure you have an active live session

3. **Try to End Session**
   - Go to vendor dashboard
   - Click "End Live Session" button
   - Check browser console for detailed logs

4. **Verify Success**
   - Session should end successfully
   - UI should update immediately
   - Success message should appear

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### If Still Having Issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for detailed logs with emojis (🔄, ✅, ❌)
   - Note any authentication errors
   - Verify DELETE request is being sent

2. **Check Network Tab**
   - Verify DELETE request to `/api/vendor/go-live`
   - Check response status and body
   - Ensure cookies are being sent

3. **Verify Session State**
   - Ensure you have an active session to end
   - Check if session belongs to your user account
   - Verify vendor profile exists

4. **Check Server Logs**
   - Look for API logs in terminal
   - Check for authentication/database errors
   - Verify vendor and session lookup

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Successful End Session:
1. ✅ Authentication validated
2. ✅ Vendor found for user
3. ✅ Active session located
4. ✅ Session ended in database
5. ✅ UI updated immediately
6. ✅ Success message displayed

### Error Scenarios:
- **No Active Session**: Clear message explaining no session to end
- **Authentication Failed**: Specific auth error with user info
- **Database Error**: Technical details with debug information
- **Network Error**: Connection issue with retry suggestion

## 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **Reliability**: Service role client ensures consistent database access
2. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for easy troubleshooting  
3. **User Experience**: Clear error messages and immediate feedback
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of all edge cases
